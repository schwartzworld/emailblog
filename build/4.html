        <div dir="auto">An experiment, trying something out. The idea is to have a static site generator that is more convenient to use than a server rendered blog with an admin dashboard.<div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Posts are sent via email. The app downloads the emails via POP3 and turns them into the posts you see here, committing them to the repo and pushing then up to GitHub. The frontend is served as static files by netlify. </div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">This site is a proof of concept, later implementations will include features like multiple rss feeds (including a podcast feed) as well as comments.</div><div dir="auto"><br></div><div dir="auto">Relying on email makes a lot of sense. It&#39;s a completely federated system that pretty much everybody has already bought into. It works well in situations with poor connectivity. POP3 is effectively a FIFO queue. Email the address, and your picture or audio recording will go live after the next build (every 5 minutes or so). Pretty cool if you ask me. </div><div dir="auto"><br></div></div>
