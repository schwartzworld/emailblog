  <title>What is this website?</title>
  <description>An experiment, trying something out. The idea is to have a static site
generator that is more convenient to use than a server rendered blog with
an admin dashboard.

Posts are sent via email. The app downloads the emails via POP3 and turns
them into the posts you see here, committing them to the repo and pushing
then up to GitHub. The frontend is served as static files by netlify.

This site is a proof of concept, later implementations will include
features like multiple rss feeds (including a podcast feed) as well as
comments.

Relying on email makes a lot of sense. It's a completely federated system
that pretty much everybody has already bought into. It works well in
situations with poor connectivity. POP3 is effectively a FIFO queue. Email
the address, and your picture or audio recording will go live after the
next build (every 5 minutes or so). Pretty cool if you ask me.
